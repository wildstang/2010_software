 * 
 * This class implements a linear, digital filter.  All types of FIR and IIR filters are supported.  Static
 * factory methods are provided to create commonly used types of filters.
 *
 * Filters are of the form:
 *  y[n] = (b0*x[n] + b1*x[n-1] + ... + bP*x[n-P) - (a0*y[n-1] + a2*y[n-2] + ... + aQ*y[n-Q])
 *
 * Where:
 *  y[n] is the output at time "n"
 *  x[n] is the input at time "n"
 *  y[n-1] is the output from the LAST time step ("n-1")
 *  x[n-1] is the input from the LAST time step ("n-1")
 *  b0...bP are the "feedforward" (FIR) gains
 *  a0...aQ are the "feedback" (IIR) gains
 * IMPORTANT!  Note the "-" sign in front of the feedback term!  This is a common convention in signal processing.
 *
 * What can linear filters do?  Basically, they can filter - or diminish - the effects of undesirable input
 * frequencies.  High frequencies - or rapid changes - can be indicative of sensor noise or be otherwise undesirable.
 * A "low pass" filter smooths out the signal, reducing the impact of these high frequency components.  Likewise, a 
 * "high pass" filter gets rid of slow-moving signal components, letting you detect large changes more easily.
 *
 * Example FRC applications of filters:
 *  - Getting rid of noise from an analog sensor input (note: the cRIO's FPGA can do this faster in hardware)
 *  - Smoothing out joystick input to prevent the wheels from slipping or the robot from tipping
 *  - Smoothing motor commands so that unnecessary strain isn't put on electrical or mechanical components
 *  - If you use clever gains, you can make a PID controller out of this class!
 *
 * For more on filters, I highly recommend the following articles:
 *  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_filter
 *  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iir_filter
 *  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fir_filter
 * 
 * Note 1: Rather than enforce an interface for "filtered" components to implement, it was decided that this
 * should be a synchronous function.  That is, Calculate() should be called by the user on a known, regular period.
 * You can set up a Notifier to do this (look at the WPILib PIDController class), or do it "inline" with code in a 
 * periodic function.
 *
 * Note 2: For ALL filters, gains are necessarily a function of frequency.  If you make a filter that works
 * well for you at, say, 100Hz, you will most definitely need to adjust the gains if you then want to run it at
 * 200Hz!  Combining this with Note 1 - the impetus is on YOU as a developer to make sure Calculate() gets 
 * called at the desired, constant frequency!
